            <h2 id="Welcome">Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the class! My name is Shane Panter and I will be your instructor for this course. For many students, 
              this will be the first time you have been exposed to web development topics. This course has been designed to take 
              someone who has never seen these concepts before to being able to produce relatively complex programs in 16 weeks. 
              This class is a three credit course and it is specifically designed to require 8 to 10 hours of work each week. 
              In order to succeed in the course, it will be critical for you to manage your time effectively and keep up with the reading and lab activities. 
              Please take some time to get familiar with the course website. Pay close attention to when the homework assignments are due to ensure you get everything in on time.</p>
            <p>We will be interacting with each other primarily through Github, discussion forums, and videos. Get started by completing the Course Introduction homework below!</p>

              <p>Final grades will be assigned with the formula [Earned Points]/[Total Points].</p>
              <p>For example, if you earn 760 points out of 1000 points offered your grade would be a 76%. 
                So your final letter grade will be a C according to the chart below. Grades will not be rounded, 
                if you are on a grade boundary please see the <a href="https://www.google.com">extra credit</a> section below for opportunities to improve your grade.</p>

              <h3 id="passing">Can I still pass?</h3>
              <p>The passing grade for courses in the Computer Science Department is 70%. 
                So we can calculate the absolute minimum number of points that you need to earn in this course as 701. 
                To know if you still can pass the course all you need to do is take your current grade and then add in any points that you could still earn before the end of the semester. 
                If that number is below 701 then it is not mathematically possible for you to pass the class.</p>

              <h3 id="incomplete">Incomplete</h3>
              <p>Instructors can enter a grade of I—for incomplete—if both of the following conditions are present:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>You have completed either 80% of the course or 80% of the coursework.</li>
                <li>Extenuating circumstances make it impossible for you to complete the course before the end of the semester.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Be aware that the University considers an extenuating circumstance to be along the lines of "I was in the hospital for the last 2 weeks in a coma". 
                More information can be found on the registrar's page.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Please review the academic-integrity policy set by the university. 
                Violations of this policy will result in the student receiving a failing grade 
                (F) for the course.</li>
                <li>It is expected that all students read and follow the University policy 2020. 
                  Any violation of University policy 2020 can result in the student being removed from the class discussion and study groups. 
                  The students' participation score will be set to 0 and no alternative assignment will be given. 
                  Egregious behavior will be reported to the dean of students for additional sanctions which can include receiving a failing grade (F) in the course.
